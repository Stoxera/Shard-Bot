# Privacy Policy - Shard Bot

**Last Updated: December 23, 2025**

Your privacy is our priority. This policy explains what data Shard collects through its Mongoose/MongoDB database and how it is used.

### 1. Data We Collect
* **Guild Data:** We store Server IDs, Server Names, Prefix, and Language settings to provide a customized experience.
* **User Data:** We store User IDs for moderation features like warnings (warns), blacklists, and role management.
* **Channel Data:** We store Channel IDs for logs, welcomes, and leaves as configured by the administrators.
* **Content:** We do not store message content permanently. Message content is only processed in real-time to execute commands.

### 2. How We Use Data
* Data is used strictly for the functionality of the bot (e.g., sending a welcome message to the correct channel or applying a mute).
* We do not use your data for advertising or any other purpose outside of Discord bot functionality.

### 3. Data Storage and Security
* All data is stored securely in a MongoDB database.
* Access to this database is restricted to the core development team of Shard.

### 4. Data Deletion
* If you wish to have your data or your server's data removed from our database, please join our support server and contact the administrators: https://discord.gg/sy5AkdfmPm
* Data is automatically eligible for deletion if the bot has been removed from a server for more than 30 days.

### 5. Third Parties
* We never sell or share your data with third-party services.
